# Accident Detection System

This project implements an accident detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). The system can analyze a video file to predict whether an accident has occurred.

## Features

- Upload a video file for accident detection.
- Real-time prediction of accidents using a trained CNN model.
- Beep sound alert when an accident is detected.
- Simple and intuitive GUI for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. *Python 3.8 or later*
2. *Required Python libraries:*
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - TensorFlow/Keras
   - Winsound (for beep sound, Windows only)
   - Tkinter (comes with Python standard library)

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
    git clone https://github.com/NithinAruva/AccidentDetectionSystem.git
    cd AccidentDetectionSystem
   

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. Install dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   
## How to Run

!. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the application:
   bash
   python main.py
   
3.Use the GUI to:

 - Click "Upload Video & Detect Accident".
 - Select a video file from the videos/ directory.
 - View the prediction result displayed on the video.
 - Press Q to exit the video window during playback.

## How It Works

### Model Loading:
- The pre-trained CNN model architecture is loaded from model/model.json.
- Weights are loaded from model/model_weights.h5.

### Video Processing:
- Each frame of the video is resized to the model's input size (120x120).
- Pixel values are normalized between 0 and 1.

### Prediction:
- The CNN model predicts whether an accident has occurred in the frame.
- If an accident is detected, a beep sound is played.

### GUI:
- The GUI is built using Tkinter, allowing users to upload videos and view results interactively.

## Future Enhancements

- *Live Webcam Support:* Add functionality to analyze live webcam feeds for real-time accident detection.
- *Platform-Independent Sound Alerts:* Implement a cross-platform solution for sound alerts to replace the winsound library.
- *Enhanced Model Accuracy:* Improve the model's performance by training it on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- *Standalone Executable:* Package the application as a standalone executable for easier distribution and usage without requiring Python.
- *Event Logging:* Add logging capabilities to keep a record of detected accidents and other relevant events.
